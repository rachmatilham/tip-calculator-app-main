## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend build tooling

### What I learned

In this project, I learned to make a calculator for the first time using typescript, including to use type for the component props. There's still found some error on initial commit related to the data typing.

### Continued development

I still have room to improve this project such as fixing the selected tip button color, improve the number input placeholder and default value of the states, and make a better user experience on using this calculator.
